With a solid foundation in programming languages and agile development methodologies, I demonstrate resilience and discipline in every project.

 
I am confident in my abilities to tackle technical and conceptual challenges, backed by a strong work ethic and a high level of commitment to quality and excellence.
My vocation for software development drives me to constantly seek opportunities to learn and grow, keeping abreast of the latest trends and technological advances in the industry. 

In short, I am continously learning and developing new skills.


> This website is focused on publishing write-ups, papers and some news of interest about cybersecurity and ethical hacking, as a way to keep a personal record of my progress in the preparation for the eJPT certification.
